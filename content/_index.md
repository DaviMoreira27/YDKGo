# About the Book

Go programming language study notes turned book.

This book is inspired by ['You Don't Know JS Yet' (YDKJS)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series. YDKJS helped me understand JavaScript under the hood, after more than 8 years writing software with JS.

You Don't Know Go (YDKGo) book was created based on [Ultimate Go training](https://www.ardanlabs.com/ultimate-go/), which is an intermediate-level class for engineers with some experience with Go trying to dig deeper into the language.
